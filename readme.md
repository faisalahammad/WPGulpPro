## Getting Started

#### ⚡️ Quick Overview

Run step `#1`, `#2`, and `#3` quickly in one go — Run inside local WP install's theme/plugin folder E.g. `/wp.local/wp-content/plugins/your-plugin` or `/wp.local/wp-content/themes/your-theme` directory.

```sh
# 1— Install WPGulpPro in your WordPress theme/plugin.
npx wpgulppro
# 2— Now configure variables inside the `wpgulp.config.js` file.
# 3— Start your npm build workflow.
npm start
```

([npx](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner) is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher).

> 🎛 _If you want to study the detailed installation of step `#1` , `#2`, and `#3` — then take a look at the steps below_.

<br>
<details>
 <summary><strong><code>STEP #0</code></strong> — Don't have <code>Node.js</code> + <code>npm</code> installed? Read this. (CLICK TO EXPAND!)</summary>

In case you are an absolute beginner to the world of `Node.js`, JavaScript, and `npm` packages — all you need to do is go to the Node's site [download + install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Node on your system. This will install both `Node.js` and `npm`, i.e., node package manager — the command line interface of Node.js.

You can verify the install by opening your terminal app and typing...

```sh
node -v
# Results into v20.0.0 or higher — make sure you have Node >= 20 installed.

npm -v
# Results into 10.0.0 or higher — make sure you have npm >= 9 installed.
```

</details>

### → `STEP #1` — Download the Required Files

1. In the terminal go to the root folder of your WordPress plugin/theme
2. Run the following command to download all the files from the [WPGulpPro repository](https://github.com/faisalahammad/WPGulpPro)

_It'll take a couple of minutes to install._

```sh
npx wpgulppro
```

([npx](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner) is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher).

![wpgulp install gif](https://a.cl.ly/c846c265e03a/c)

> ⚠️ I'm assuming that there are no previously present similar files in the root of your folder. Otherwise, you need to merge these very carefully. E.g. You can include the `scripts`, `devDependencies` in your current `package.json` file and so on for other files. If you run the above command all similar files will be overwritten.

### → `STEP #2` — Editing the Project Variables

Configure the project paths and other variables inside the `wpgulp.config.js` file. This is a compulsory step.

![wpgulp config](https://a.cl.ly/f2ca9bb4a740/c)

### → `STEP #3` — Start your project

Once the installation is done, you can open your project (WordPress plugin/theme) folder and run the start script.

```sh
npm start

# To stop press CTRL (⌃) + C
```

![wpgulp start](https://a.cl.ly/d64abd87de1f/c)

### → `OPTIONAL STEP #4` — More Scripts/Tasks

To optimize images and generate WP POT translation file, or generate a RTL stylesheet you can run the following commands

```sh
# To optimize images.
npm run images

# To generate WP POT translation file.
npm run translate

# To generate RTL stylesheets and Sourcemap.
npm run styles-rtl

# To generate theme/plugin zip file without extranious files.
npm run zip
```

<br>

## 🔧 Alternative Installation (Before npm Release)

The `wpgulppro` package is not yet published to npm. Use one of these methods instead:

### Method 1: GitHub Install (Recommended)

```sh
# Navigate to your WordPress theme/plugin folder
cd /path/to/your-theme

# Install directly from GitHub
npm install faisalahammad/WPGulpPro

# Run the installer
npx wpgulppro
```

### Method 2: npm link (Development)

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/faisalahammad/WPGulpPro.git
cd WPGulpPro

# Link globally
npm link

# Navigate to your theme/plugin folder
cd /path/to/your-theme

# Run the installer
wpgulppro
```

### Method 3: ZIP Download

1. Download [WPGulpPro ZIP](https://github.com/faisalahammad/WPGulpPro/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
2. Extract the files to your theme/plugin folder
3. Run `npm install`

<br>

## How to Update?

1. Download all the latest files from the [WPGulpPro repository](https://github.com/faisalahammad/WPGulpPro) by running `npx wpgulppro` - it will overwrite all the wpgulp files.
2. Open terminal and install WPGulpPro's node dependencies by running the `npm install` commands in the root folder of your WordPress plugin/theme.

## FAQ

### Why Node 20+ required?

Node 20+ ensures compatibility with modern JavaScript features and security updates. Older Node versions (14, 16, 18) have reached or are approaching End of Life.

### What's different from original WPGulp?

| Feature | WPGulp | WPGulpPro |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Node Support | Node 10+ | Node 20/22/24 |
| Sass Compiler | node-sass (deprecated) | Dart Sass |
| Dependencies | Outdated | Latest compatible |
| Maintenance | 2019 | Active |

### Can I use this with existing WPGulp projects?

Yes, but you'll need to:
1. Backup your `wpgulp.config.js`
2. Run `npx wpgulppro` to get new files
3. Restore your custom `wpgulp.config.js`
4. Run `npm install` to get new dependencies

### How do I migrate from node-sass to Dart Sass?

Dart Sass is a drop-in replacement. If you're using WPGulpPro, it's already configured. For manual migration:

```bash
# Remove old node-sass
npm uninstall node-sass

# Install Dart Sass
npm install sass
```

### Image optimization fails for WebP/AVIF?

The `gulp-imagemin` v7 has limited support for modern formats. Images are processed with smart detection—unsupported formats are skipped. For full WebP/AVIF support, consider using a separate image optimization pipeline.
